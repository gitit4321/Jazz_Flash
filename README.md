# Jazz Flash
This is the first rendition of what will become a fully fledged mobile quiz application. Built with React Native, the application runs on both Android and iPhone devices. My goal is to make this resource available to instuctors, students, hobbyist, or anyone else that wishes strengthen their jazz theory knowledge base. The current form of Jazz Flash is essentially a reference for scales, chord qualities, and basic keyboard voicings. However, I look forward to building out its funcitonality to incude more 'quiz' like elements that will test the user on appropriate scales and keyboard voicings for selected chord qualities.  

In addition to several screen shots below, you can also find a video demo at the bottom of this page.


## Live Scale and Chord Tone Rendering
Examples of the root, chord quality, and clef selection functionality. Appropriate scales for the selected chord quality are genereated by the application and can be seleced by the user. In these two examples the user selected 'Harmonic Major' and 'Super Locrian'.

## Live '5/9 Plane Voicings' and 'Rootless CED ('Cheap Easy Dirty') Voicings' Rendering
Examples of the '5/9 Plane Voicings' and 'Rootless CED' Voicings' functionality. These vocings are generated according to the user selected chord quality and are a great way for beginning keyboard players or more advanced non-keyboard players to identify quaity 'jazz appropriate' chord voicings.
